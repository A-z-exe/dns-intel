## 🚀 Overview

DNS Intel is an open-source DNS intelligence platform designed to assist security professionals in reconnaissance, asset discovery, DNS monitoring, and infrastructure analysis.

The project combines multiple intelligence sources into a unified command-line interface, enabling researchers to identify assets, monitor DNS changes, discover subdomains, and build domain relationship graphs.

---

## ✨ Features

| Module | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 🔎 DNS Lookup | Query A, AAAA, MX, NS, TXT, CNAME, and SOA records |
| 🔄 Reverse DNS | Resolve PTR records from IP addresses |
| 📜 Certificate Transparency | Discover subdomains using CT logs via crt.sh |
| 🌐 ASN Intelligence | Retrieve ASN, prefix, and organization information |
| 🕵️ Subdomain Enumeration | Multithreaded subdomain discovery |
| 🕸️ Domain Graph | Generate domain relationship maps (JSON export) |
| 💾 History Tracking | Store and compare historical scan results |
| 🔔 Real-time Monitoring | Detect infrastructure changes with Telegram alerts |
| 🚀 Full Recon | Execute all modules with a single command |

---

## 📦 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/A-z-exe/dns-intel.git
cd dns-intel
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the project root for Telegram alerts:

```env
TELEGRAM_TOKEN=your_bot_token_here
TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=your_chat_id_here
```

**How to get your credentials:**
1. Open `@BotFather` on Telegram → send `/newbot` → copy the token
2. Open `@userinfobot` on Telegram → copy your Chat ID

> **Security:** `.env` is git-ignored and must never be committed. If a bot token is
> exposed, revoke it with `/revoke` in `@BotFather` and create a new one. Use
> `.env.example` as the template.

## 🖥️ Usage

### DNS Lookup
```bash
python cli.py dns example.com
```

### Reverse DNS
```bash
python cli.py rdns 1.1.1.1
```

### Certificate Transparency
```bash
python cli.py cert example.com
```

### ASN Lookup
```bash
python cli.py asn 1.1.1.1
```

### Subdomain Enumeration
```bash
python cli.py sub example.com
```

### Domain Relationship Graph
```bash
python cli.py graph example.com
```

### Compare Results Over Time
```bash
python cli.py compare example.com --type subdomains
```

### 🔔 Real-time Monitoring + Telegram Alerts
```bash
# Monitor DNS records every hour
python cli.py monitor example.com --interval 3600 --type dns

# Monitor subdomains every 6 hours
python cli.py monitor example.com --interval 21600 --type subdomains
```

When a change is detected, you receive a Telegram alert:
```
🔔 DNS Change Detected
🌐 Domain: example.com

✅ Added:
  + 192.168.1.1

❌ Removed:
  - 10.0.0.1
```

### Full Recon (All Modules)
```bash
python cli.py full example.com
```
